<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong (all schools); <strong>CL</strong> 20th<br>
<strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> â€”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This stone statuette of a dragon is one of five royal seals of Minkai, and represents the Amatatsu familyâ€™s divine right to rule the empire of Minkai. Should no Amatatsus of pure blood be able to take up that charge, however, the Amatatsu Seal can invest the right to rule as an Amatatsu in any number of living humanoid hosts. These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of the past, present, and possible future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Amatatsu Seal</em> has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: <em>cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease,</em> or <em>restoration</em>. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast <em>heal</em> on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the sealâ€™s discretion, it can cast <em>resurrection</em> on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting powers useless for a month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Amatatsu Seal</em> itself radiates strong magic, and those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents, allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove the seal from its <em>warding box</em>, for as long as the <em>warding box</em> is open, the oni of the Five Storms can track it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One final ward exists on the <em>Amatatsu Seal</em>, confounding attempts to whisk it quickly away from its homeland but also making returning a stolen seal home an arduous task. The <em>Amatatsu Seal</em> can never be transported by teleportation magic or dimensional travel. It cannot be taken from the Material Plane save via special portals blessed by the gods, and characters who carry the seal cannot cast or otherwise use teleportation effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To destroy the <em>Amatatsu Seal</em>, rightful scions of each of the five royal families of Minkai must, of their own free will, cast their familiesâ€™ seals together into the Well of Demons in the Imperial Shrine in Kasai Harbor.</p>

<p>This +1 flaming burst shuriken is etched with the image of an erupting volcano. Any creature damaged by an earthfire shuriken must make a DC 15 Reflex save or catch fire.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These small grenades are made from hollowed eggshells filled with assorted powders and reagents and inscribed with magical glyphs. When broken, a fugitiveâ€™s grenade creates a 10-foot-radius cloud that lasts for 2 rounds. This cloud is otherwise identical to a fog cloud. A single smoke tendril in the center of the cloud forms a solid-feeling rope, 20 feet long, that functions as a rope trick spell. When the smoke cloud dissipates, so does the smoke rope, though the rope trickâ€™s extradimensional space remains for its full duration. Once the smoke rope disperses, any creatures inside the extradimensional space must jump or climb out by other means. A fugitiveâ€™s grenade may be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.</p>

</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Cleats</dt>
<dd>
<p>These footgear spikes improve the wearerâ€™s ability to move across icy surfaces. Each square of icy terrain costs only 1.5 squares of movement rather than 2 (or 3 squares rather than 4, for sloped icy terrain).</p>

<p>This conveyance is typically pulled by 1 or more riding dogs; the sled and any cargo are counted against the total carrying capacity of all dogs in the team to determine encumbrance. If the party is using caravan rules, a dog sled has the following statistics: <strong>hp</strong> 10; <strong>Traveler Capacity</strong> 1, <strong>Cargo Capacity</strong> 2; <strong>Limit</strong> none; <strong>Consumption</strong> 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Frostbite Ointment</dt>
<dd>
<p>One hour after being applied, this alchemical salve cures any creature suffering from frostbite, though any nonlethal damage from cold or exposure remains until the victim recovers. A creature cannot benefit from frostbite ointment more than once in 24 hours.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Furs</dt>

<dd>
<p>These husky, shaggy beasts are sometimes domesticated as pack animals in the Crown of the World. Their statistics are identical to aurochs (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 174), but they are immune to cold weather effects (though not severe cold and extreme cold effects). Domesticated musk oxen have the docile special quality (see horse; Bestiary 177), and treat their gore attack as a secondary natural weapon. In the polar rim mountains of Tian Xia, yaks are used as pack animals and have identical statistics.</p>

<p>This simple tool is useful for digging shelters or through drifts and other snow barriers.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Skates</dt>
<dd>
<p>These honed metal blades are worn on boots to enable swift passage over ice. The wearer may move (but not climb) at her full speed on level icy surfaces. Her speed is halved when moving up an icy slope, but she may run or charge downhill on gentle or steep snowy slopes at quadruple speed. However, any skill check penalties for traversing rough ice while wearing skates are doubled, and the wearer takes a â€“4 penalty on combat maneuver checks to bull rush, drag, or trip, and to CMD against these maneuvers. Donning or removing skates takes 1 minute.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Skis and Poles</dt>
<dd>
<p>These polished wooden slats enable the wearer to glide across level snowy surfaces at his full speed. His speed is halved when moving up a snowy slope, but he may run or charge downhill on gentle or steep snowy slopes at quadruple speed. Any skill check penalties for traversing rough snowy terrain while wearing skis are doubled, and the wearer takes a â€“4 penalty on combat maneuver checks to bull rush, drag, or trip, and to CMD against these maneuvers. Characters cannot climb while wearing skis. Donning or removing skis takes 1 minute.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Snowshoes</dt>
<dd>
<p>This wide footgear made of gut or leather webbing laced across wooden frames improves the wearerâ€™s ability to move across snowy surfaces. Snowshoes reduce the penalty for walking through heavy snow by 50%; for example, if moving through snow normally costs you 2 squares of movement per square traveled, snowshoes reduce this cost to 1.5 squares per square traveled.</p>

<p><em>Suishen</em> is a <em>+2 defending flaming katana</em>. The ancestral blade of the Amatatsu family, <em>Suishen</em> is believed to contain the soul of the first Amatatsu emperor of Minkai. It has been passed down through generations of the family, serving as advisor and spiritual guide. It was actually _Suishen_â€™s idea to be sold to Fynn Snaevald in order to save the family line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Suishen</em> can detect any scion of the Amatatsu family within 60 feet, whether a natural-born descendant or a person invested with the right to rule as an Amatatsu (such as a creature marked by the <em>Amatatsu Seal</em>). Although <em>Suishen</em> is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion, regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level. This boon is at <em>Suishen_â€™s discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict. Even though _Suishen</em> can likely dominate anyone who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder, provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scionâ€”though after 50 years of holding its silence, <em>Suishen</em> is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very gruff, no-nonsense manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Suishen</em> has a number of additional abilities as well, though it reveals these powers to its wielder only after she has shown herself honorable and worthy of bearing the familyâ€™s heirloom blade. Each time <em>Suishen_â€™s wielder is involved in a fight in which an oni of the Five Storms is killed, the wielder is made aware of one new power in the following order. If a new person wields _Suishen</em>, that person must learn the swordâ€™s additional powers all over again.</p>

The box can hold one object no larger than 8 inches Ã— 8 inches Ã— 3 inches (or up to 25 pounds) in each of its three compartments at any one time. The boxâ€™s lid and additional compartments are sealed, but the box can be opened or closed as a full-round action.
