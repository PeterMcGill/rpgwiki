<h2 id="_amatatsu_seal_minor_artifact">Amatatsu Seal (Minor Artifact)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Aura</strong> strong (all schools); <strong>CL</strong> 20th<br>
<strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> —</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This stone statuette of a dragon is one of five royal seals of Minkai, and represents the Amatatsu family’s divine right to rule the empire of Minkai. Should no Amatatsus of pure blood be able to take up that charge, however, the Amatatsu Seal can invest the right to rule as an Amatatsu in any number of living humanoid hosts. These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of the past, present, and possible future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Amatatsu Seal</em> has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: <em>cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease,</em> or <em>restoration</em>. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast <em>heal</em> on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges. Finally, and only at the seal’s discretion, it can cast <em>resurrection</em> on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so renders its spellcasting powers useless for a month.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Amatatsu Seal</em> itself radiates strong magic, and those with the proper resources can sense this magic across oceans and continents, allowing it to be tracked across any distance. Originally meant to allow its rightful owners the ability to track it if stolen, this feature makes it dangerous to remove the seal from its <em>warding box</em>, for as long as the <em>warding box</em> is open, the oni of the Five Storms can track it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One final ward exists on the <em>Amatatsu Seal</em>, confounding attempts to whisk it quickly away from its homeland but also making returning a stolen seal home an arduous task. The <em>Amatatsu Seal</em> can never be transported by teleportation magic or dimensional travel. It cannot be taken from the Material Plane save via special portals blessed by the gods, and characters who carry the seal cannot cast or otherwise use teleportation effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To destroy the <em>Amatatsu Seal</em>, rightful scions of each of the five royal families of Minkai must, of their own free will, cast their families’ seals together into the Well of Demons in the Imperial Shrine in Kasai Harbor.</p>

<h2 id="_warding_box_minor_artifact">Warding Box (Minor Artifact)</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">

<p><strong>Aura</strong> Strong abjuration; <strong>CL</strong> 20th<br>
<strong>Slot</strong> none; <strong>Weight</strong> 5 lbs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>warding box</em> is a powerful magical container built to obscure and confound any attempt to locate objects kept inside. The box can hold one object no larger than 8 inches × 8 inches × 3 inches (or up to 25 pounds) in each of its three compartments at any one time. The box’s lid and additional compartments are sealed, but the box can be opened or closed as a full-round action. While the lid is closed, the <em>warding box</em> and all objects inside it are protected from all divination spells. In this state, no divination spell save for those employed by the gods can detect the <em>warding box</em> or its contents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>warding box</em> can be destroyed by placing a <em>portable hole</em> inside it, closing the lid, and then placing the box inside a second <em>portable hole</em>. This second <em>portable hole</em> must be closed, and then a <em>wish</em> must be used to switch the two <em>portable holes</em>. Doing so destroys both <em>portable holes</em> and the <em>warding box</em> along with them.</p>
