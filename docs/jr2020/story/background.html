<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the region known today as Varisia has long been inhabited (all the way back to the Age of Legend, when powerful wizards known as runelords ruled the region as the Empire of Thassilon), it wasnâ€™t until relatively recently that it came to the attention of the nations of the Inner Sea. Cheliax made an aggressive attempt to colonize Varisia, but conflict with its native peoples and the remote location made such attempts difficult. By the time of Arodenâ€™s death and the Chelish Civil War, Cheliaxâ€™s colonies in Varisia had already become independent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the inland highlands of Varisia remain wild and untamed, a fair amount of its coastal lowlands are now civilized. Three cities in particularâ€”Korvosa, Magnimar, and Riddleportâ€”represent civilizationâ€™s three greatest modern triumphs in the region. Each of these cities has a number of smaller villages in its outlying reaches, and of these smaller settlements, the town of Sandpoint is among the largest and most successfulâ€”the perfect spot for fledgling heroes to start careers of adventure.</p>

<p>Founded in 4666 ar along the Lost Coast, just a dayâ€™s ride north of Magnimar, Sandpoint has grown into a rustic and prosperous town of just over 1,200 citizens. The town has dealt with a number of disasters in the past 5 decades, including several powerful storms, goblin uprisings, trouble with dragons, devastating fires, and deranged serial killers. Yet Sandpoint weathered these trials and emerged stronger after each one. Today, the town hosts several thriving industries (including lumber, fishing, farming, and glassblowing) as well as a number of unique businesses and entertainment venues. The town seems comfortable in its transitory position between rural charm and urban convenience, and is a healthy and vibrant settlement despite its slow growth.</p>

<p>Although Sandpoint is a relatively small town with citizens prone to living relaxed and unexciting lives, the townâ€™s hinterlands hold numerous opportunities for adventure. As such, many of Sandpointâ€™s businesses cater to adventurers. The following locations and services offered in Sandpoint should be of particular interest to adventuring PCs.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Sandpoint Cathedral</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tended by Father Abstalar Zantus, a cleric of Desna, the Sandpoint Cathedral is a pantheistic temple that contains shrines to Abadar, Desna, Erastil, Gozreh, Sarenrae, and Shelyn. Zantus and his four 1st-level acolytes can provide a limited amount of healing every day.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Places to Relax</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sandpoint offers several places to relax and spend the night, including taverns, inns, and even a brothel. The White Deer and the Rusty Dragon are Sandpointâ€™s two innsâ€”their prices are comparable, but the Rusty Dragon specifically caters to adventurers, and its owner, Ameiko Kaijitsu, has been known to offer discount rates to adventurers in return for entertaining tales of their escapades. For taverns and eateries, visitors can choose between Cracktoothâ€™s Tavern (specializing in amateur entertainments, ale, and crunchy snacks), Fatmanâ€™s Feedbag (specializing in enormous servings of mediocre food, rum, and bar fights), the Hagfish (specializing in seafood, gambling, and boasting), Risaâ€™s Place (specializing in potato dishes, cider, and stories; particularly valued by the locals since this place isnâ€™t well known by visitors), and the Rusty Dragon (specializing in spicy and exotic dishes, mead, and adventurers). The Pixieâ€™s Kitten is Sandpointâ€™s only brothel, but its sense of style and panache belies the rural environs.</p>

<h2 id="_goblins">Goblins</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Goblins have lived along the Lost Coast for as long as anyone can remember, but that certainly doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re welcome. Viewed as pests by most and monsters by all, goblinsâ€™ reliance on the garbage of greater societies has ensured their simpering, cavorting proximity to better civilizations since the start. Goblins are naturally craven, gleefully foolish, and ever eager to visit atrocity and pain upon those they encounter, a combination that one might think would have led to their eradication by their betters long ago. But goblins are fecund and stubborn if nothing else. Much to the distress of the rest of us, goblins are here to stay.</p>

<h2 id="_sandpoint_devil">Sandpoint Devil</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They say itâ€™s bad luck to see the Sandpoint Devilâ€”that itâ€™s the son of a widow who brokered a deal with a devil to gain a child, and that it stalks children and snatches them from their beds through windows left foolishly open. They say the beast is so hideous that even drawings and pictures of the fiend are prone to bursting into flame. That the Sandpoint Devil actually exists is not debatedâ€”itâ€™s been sighted by too many reputable folk, and savaged too many innocent victims to be compeltely a myth. Rumors abound as to its lair and its genesis, but the Devil itself is very much a real creatureâ€”flesh and blood and smoke and fire and all.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_kaijitsu_family">Kaijitsu Family</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Kaijitsu family is known for their artistry and skill at glassblowing, are part of the Varisian aristocracy of merchant nobles, and are one of the four founding families of Sandpoint. They previously resided in the city of Magnimar (west of Sandpoint along the coast). Atsuii Kaijitsu, mother of Ameiko, Tsuto, Kuro and Shiro Kaijitsu, died in a fall from the cliffs near her house, 9 years ago, in 4702 AR. In addition to the legitimate heirs of Ameiko, Kuro and Shiro, the Kaijitsu&#8217;s also have an estranged half-sister Amaya, in Westcrown, born from Lonjikoâ€™s scandalous affair with a Chelish noblewoman in 4680.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_ameiko_kaijitsu">Ameiko Kaijitsu</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although sheâ€™s technically the head of one of Sandpointâ€™s noble families, Ameiko Kaijitsu is more at home running things at her tavern, the Rusty Dragon, than she is among the small townâ€™s aristocracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ameiko is a beautiful but somewhat irreverent woman of Tian descent who runs Sandpointâ€™s Rusty Dragon tavern and happens to be a member of one of Sandpointâ€™s founding families. Her parents and older siblings have met unfortunate ends over the past several years, leaving the young woman as the sole remaining Kaijitsu in town. Ameiko may be among the townâ€™s nobility, but sheâ€™s never really cared for the aristocracyâ€”sheâ€™s always had an urge to explore, and loves hearing stories of adventures and daring deeds. While she has a lot of friends and admirers in town, Ameiko has never accepted anyone as anything more than a friend, diplomatically avoiding personal questions and proposals of romance, much to the frustration of several eager suitors in Sandpoint. Sheâ€™s a talented singer and samisen player, and if she wanted, Ameiko could probably lead a comfortable life in Sandpoint, but sheâ€™s growing increasingly bored and impatient with having a â€œsafe lifeâ€? in a â€œsafe town.â€? If the chance to go on a grand adventure presents itself, sheâ€™d sell the Rusty Dragon in a heartbeat to seek her fortune.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ameiko was born in 4689 AR to Lonjiku and Atsuii Kaijitsu. Although sheâ€™s not Atsuiiâ€™s or Lonjikuâ€™s first child, she was the first legitimate child from that marriage. Ameiko had a lonely childhood. Her father strictly controlled who she could keep as friends, and filled her days with lessons in music, diplomacy, magic, and academic subjects. He kept a close eye on her, but Ameiko still managed to sneak into town to play with friends, explore old buildings, and visit her half-elven half-brother Tsuto at Sandpointâ€™s Turandarok Academy every chance she could.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When she was 13, Ameiko tried to reconcile the bad blood between her brother Tsuto and father, but the attempt backfired. Tsuto struck her in a fit of rage, and Ameiko was so betrayed and distraught by this that she ran away from home to Magnimar for several months. When she learned of her motherâ€™s death in a fall from the cliffs near her house, though, Ameiko returned home to Sandpoint. She found life at home more unpleasant than ever, but when another family argument broke out at her motherâ€™s funeral and Tsuto left town, Ameiko resigned herself to staying in Sandpoint to care for her father and younger siblings Kuro and Shiro.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ameiko left home for the second time at age 16, joined an adventuring group, and became particularly good friends with the groupâ€™s priest of Shelyn, a handsome young Varisian man named Alder Vhiski. But in 4706, the group was captured by a degenerate family of backwoods cannibals living in an old mine in the southern Fogscar Mountains. The group was within a hairâ€™s breadth of being eaten, abused, and worse by the degenerates, but Alder led a heroic attempt to escape. The resulting flight from the mine was nightmarish, as members of the group were picked off one by one by the pursuing cannibals, who were led by a spry druid who favored snakes as his pets. As the group neared the exit, only Ameiko, Alder, and Alderâ€™s brother Sandru remained alive, but as they prepared to scramble into a rickety rowboat that would take them to safety, Ameiko was attacked by the druidâ€™s animal companion, a viper of prodigious size. Bitten twice, Ameiko would have died had Alder not pulled her to safety, and in so doing Alder was himself bitten. Already weakened from the fight, the snakeâ€™s venom killed him. The last Ameiko saw of Alder, he was being torn apart by the degenerates. With Sandruâ€™s help, the two survivors eventually made it back to Sandpoint, but they never spoke of what they had endured in that old mine. Some months later, Ameiko got a tattoo of a snake on her left arm and shoulder as a sort of memorial to Alder, then cashed in most of her earnings from her adventures and purchased an old tavern in downtown Sandpoint called the Rusty Dragon. Since then, sheâ€™s run the Rusty Dragon as a place for adventurers to gather and relax.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last few years have been hard on the Kaijitsu family, with the death of both father Lonjiku and half-brother Tsuto during a series of violent goblin attacks on Sandpoint. While Ameiko now runs both the Rusty Dragon and the Sandpoint Glassworks, and she still has pride in what sheâ€™s accomplished in town, her hopes to leave Sandpoint and its bitter memories behind for a grand new adventure grow with each day.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_koya_mvashti">Koya Mvashti</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While most people might think Koyaâ€™s lived a full life, she aches to make one grand journey worthy of being retold as a legend before she grows too old to travel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until she passed away from natural causes just a few months ago, Madame Niska Mvashti was the oldest person in Sandpoint. No one quite knows exactly how old the Varisian seer actually was when she died (she was already old when Sandpoint was founded over 40 years ago)â€”but the fact that her only daughter Koya is herself an old woman is a telling fact. Koya has spent a fair amount of her life traveling Varisia with a number of caravans, serving as a healer when she was younger and more recently as a fortune-teller. For the past several years, sheâ€™s in the company of her adopted son Sandru Vhiski as they travel on a regular caravan route between Riddleport, Magnimar, and Korvosa two or three times a year. Their caravan spends most of its time relatively close to Sandpoint, though, and that has suited Koya fine, since it gave her more time to care for her aged mother.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that old Niska has finally died, though, Koyaâ€™s mourning has transitioned into a sort of morose melancholy. A life-long worshiper of Desna, sheâ€™s come to realize that while sheâ€™s traveled extensively throughout the Varisian lowlands, sheâ€™s never been beyond the regionâ€™s borders. Tales of other Desnan explorers have long delighted Koyaâ€™s sense of wonderâ€”even her own mother reputedly took part in several extensive caravans that traveled as far as the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and even down to Qadira. Koyaâ€™s having something of a latelife crisis as a resultâ€”a growing sense of disappointment that sheâ€™s never made a long caravan trek. With her mother dead, Koya has little reason to stay in Varisia, and sheâ€™s been pressuring Sandru to take a long journey soon: &#8220;The sooner the better, cause I wonâ€™t be around for long!&#8221; Koyaâ€™s in remarkably good shape, physically, for a woman well over 60 years in ageâ€”obviously, longevity runs in her familyâ€”but with each year that passes, the chance of her getting to experience a truly epic journey like the ones in her favorite stories grows narrower.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Koya has wanted to travel to the far corners of Golarion since she was a child and first saw a map of the world in an old history book she came across while sneaking through her motherâ€™s impressive collection of notes, trophies, and keepsakes from her extensive travels. Although Koya has since come to learn that the old map was rather inaccurate, sheâ€™s never lost the sense of wonder she gained from the simple notion that the world sheâ€™d thought sheâ€™d known was so much larger than sheâ€™d ever imagined. Likewise, a childhood trip to Korvosa impressed upon her how different the world can be as you travel from plains to forests to swamps to mountains to large urban centers. The idea that one could make journeys 10 or even 100 times as long as the caravan route running from Sandpoint to Korvosa has long been a point of fascination and wonder for Koya.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Koya never went on that long journey. She always assumed there would be the chance for an adventure in the near future, but the present always seemed to have a knack for getting in the way. Responsibilities to her family caravan, her several tempestuous love affairs as a young woman, the task of caring for unfortunate children who had no mother of their own (most notably Sandru Vhiski, and perhaps one of the PCs if the character selected the correct Campaign Trait from the Jade Regent Playerâ€™s Guide), and most recently caring for her elderly, but not quite completely infirm, mother all worked to keep her at home. Just as one phase of her life seemed ready to close, the next began, and before she knew it, the unwelcome kiss of old age had crept into her aching bones and wrinkled face.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With her mother now dead, Koya is eager to seize what she thinks might be her last chance for that great, world-spanning journey. Lately sheâ€™s been traveling with her adopted son Sandru in his caravan, serving as a fortuneteller, and she hopes that her frequent attempts to convince him to make a long journey will bear fruit soon. Koya longs to travel beyond the borders of Varisia, whether south to Cheliax and beyond or north to the Lands of the Linnorm Kings and the Crown of the World. Koya would love to visit another continent as well, if the opportunity presented itself, so she could leave her own &#8220;found-mark&#8221; in distant lands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Koya serves as the spiritual core of the caravan. As the most likely candidate for the caravanâ€™s fortune-teller job, she serves as an advisor for most of the travelers in the caravan, and Koyaâ€™s stories, fortune-telling, and sense of humor should be a staple of all nights spent on the road. The longer the journey progresses and the more miles the caravan piles on, the more energetic and excited Koya seems to become, almost as if the journey is invigorating her rather than exhausting her, as one might expect from such a long journey.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_sandru_vhiski">Sandru Vhiski</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sandru Vhiski never took the easy path in lifeâ€”mostly because lifeâ€™s easiest path could have been to follow his brother into a life of crime among the Sczarni, a path Sandru prides himself for having never set a single foot upon.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only a few years from middle age, Sandru Vhiski is a charming man, handsome and irreverent in precisely the ways that could have made him a highly successful Sczarni con artist, even before one takes into account in the fact that his older brother, Jubrayl, is Sandpointâ€™s local Sczarni leader. Sandru doesnâ€™t live in Sandpoint, although he considers himself one of the townâ€™s citizens nevertheless. Heâ€™s only in town a few days out of every month, for his caravan is one of the regionâ€™s busier examples. Traveling with his adopted mother Koya Mvashti and a pair of Varisian brothers named Bevelek and Vankor Dalmuvian, Sandru makes the trip from Riddleport to Magnimar to Korvosa several times a year. While he makes enough money on these journeys from trade, money isnâ€™t Sandruâ€™s primary motivationâ€”he loves the road, and he loves the tradition. It doesnâ€™t take much to get Sandru talking about Varisian history, dance traditions, scarves, fortune-telling, horses and wagons, landmarks and legends. In the off-seasons, when weather makes travel too dangerous or too uncomfortable, Sandru prefers to stay in Magnimar, where he helps other Varisians with his carpentry skills and flirts with the political scene in that town. Heâ€™s not yet had the conviction to fully become a representative of his people in Magnimar, though, since he knows the call of the road will pull him from any local responsibilities as soon as the rains clear each spring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Vhiski family has been involved with the Sczarni for as many generations as anyone cares to look back upon. Not every Vhiski throws in with the gang, but enough do that when one comes along who has no interest in the Sczarni life, itâ€™s difficult for him to prove his disinterest in crime to outsiders. Sandruâ€™s early childhood schools were back alleys and waterfront taverns, and training in the art of the con, dirty fighting, sabotage, and picking locks replaced lessons in numbers, arts, and literature. From an early age, though, Sandruâ€™s sense of fairness and compassion hampered his advancement in the ranks of the Sczarni, and the mockery and derision his hesitance earned him only strengthened his convictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a violent storm struck the Varisian coast in 4687 AR, Sandruâ€™s parents were among those slain by the floods and winds that tore the Lost Coast apart. Sandru and his brothers Alder and Jubrayl emerged from that catastrophic event as orphans. Yet while tragic, this event was ironically just the thing to save Sandru from a life of crime. While Jubrayl was old enough at that point to strike out on his own (and thus fell in completely with the familyâ€™s criminal traditions), Sandru was still a young child of 7 and his younger brother Alder barely 2. His care fell to Koya Mvashti, a family friend and practically an aunt to the young Sandru. Under her guidance and support, Sandru managed to avoid falling in with the Sczarni, and when he grew of age, he sought employment as a caravan guard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For several years, Sandru avoided Sandpoint, but after he lost his job, he joined up with a group of adventurers eager to explore western Varisia. As fate would have it, Ameiko Kaijitsu was also in the group. Sandru and Ameiko hit it off at once and became close friends. Indeed, Sandru was quite taken with the lovely young woman, but their age difference (he was 26, while she was only 17) and Sandruâ€™s sense of honor kept him from pursuing a romantic relationship with her. Instead, he watched enviously (yet graciously) as Ameiko and his younger brother Alder began to fall in love.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trioâ€™s brief adventuring career was quite successful, but as recounted in Ameikoâ€™s history, ended in tragedy. For many years after Alder rescued Ameiko and lost his life to the cannibals, Sandru couldnâ€™t stand to be around the young Tianâ€”she reminded him of lost opportunities and lost family. So while Ameiko invested her adventuring spoils in Sandpoint, Sandru invested his in the road, throwing himself into a much more honorable Varisian occupation, that of caravan owner. For the next several years, Sandruâ€™s life was the road. Heâ€™s since mostly recovered from the bad times, and now visits Sandpoint and Ameiko often. He thinks of her now as a younger sister, and often worries that her capricious and often rebellious nature will someday force her to choose between the life she wants and the life sheâ€™s inherited as one of Sandpointâ€™s nobles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sandru is the owner and primary driver of the caravan destined to take the PCs over the Crown of the World and into Minkai. Just as he plays the role of surrogate older brother to Ameiko, he should start to fill that role for most, if not all, of the PCs. Sandruâ€™s led a relatively lonely life, though, and most of those who have shown romantic interest in him have been associated with the Sczarni, while those to whom he is attracted tend to see him either as a brother or are already in relationships. While Sandru knows he could woo a paramour away from his or her lover if he put his mind and his charms to the task, he also knows he could never stay long with a lover who wasnâ€™t faithful or devoted enough to stick with whoever came before him. Caught in this complex tangle of emotions and honor, Sandru has started to think of himself as a life-long bachelor, and with each passing year consigns himself to the growing certainty that heâ€™ll remain alone until his final days. As a result, while heâ€™s a friendly and personable character, he tends to miss such social cues or avoid romantic approaches entirely.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_shalelu_andosana">Shalelu Andosana</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shalelu is older than the town of Sandpoint, yet sheâ€™s come to think of it as her hometownâ€”a town that has finally grown up enough to survive on its own without her watching over it from the wild.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although Shalelu Andosana is something of a mystery in Sandpoint, sheâ€™s certainly one of the townâ€™s most admired defenders. Like Sandru Vhiski, she doesnâ€™t actually live in town, but she sometimes spends the night at the Rusty Dragon free of charge, thanks to her friendship with Ameiko Kaijitsu. Everyone in town knows that Shalelu is something of a loner and prefers to spend her time wandering and exploring the wilderness around Sandpoint. She periodically vanishes from the region for weeks or even months at a time to visit friends elsewhere in Varisia, but she never fails to return to Sandpoint. No one quite understands why she keeps coming back. When asked why, she merely says, &#8220;Someoneâ€™s got to keep an eye on you all.&#8221; Her reports of goblin activity have helped save folk from ambushes or warned the militia of possible attacks on the town or its farmlands numerous times. Yet in recent days, Sheriff Hemlock has taken a more active role in watching over the surrounding land. His militia is better trained than ever before, and Shaleluâ€™s aid in keeping an eye on the hinterlands is growing less and less necessary. She actually seems relatively pleased with this, as if sheâ€™s proud that Sandpoint is finally starting to look after itself. Sheâ€™s even hinted that sheâ€™s thinking of taking a long journey away from town sometime in the future, but when pressed for details, she just shrugs and changes the topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shalelu is still relatively young at 130 years of age, but she can remember when the Lost Coast was truly lost, when only goblin lairs and Thassilonian ruins could be found along its length. Yet for much of her life, Shaleluâ€™s visits to southern Varisia were not nearly as common. Born and raised in the small village of Crying Leaf, Shalelu is an only child whose father was slain not long after she was born by a particularly brutal bugbear assassin, exposing Shalelu to far more goblinoid cruelty than most elves her age dream of in their worst nightmares.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It took Shaleluâ€™s mother Seanthia nearly a hundred years to find a new love, and when she did, she chose a human mercenary, scandalizing much of Crying Leaf. As shocking as the choice may have been, Shalelu saw how happy this man Jakardos made her mother, and she loved him as a father for that kindness. But when her mother died in a fight a green dragon a few years later, Jakardos left without saying goodbye, shattering Shaleluâ€™s opinion of him. The loss of her mother and stepfather sent Shalelu into a terrible depression, and she left Crying Leaf to seek out a new home.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shalelu came to Sandpoint, where she found a burgeoning human village that was growing rapidly into a town, but that was plagued by goblins. Shalelu took Sandpoint under her wing, and for many years she protected it from goblins, bugbears, ghouls, and worse. Recently, Shalelu sought out Jakardos at his new home in central Varisia, and her reconciliation with her aging stepfather finally helped her come to terms with the violent attack that killed her mother. And when Shalelu returned to Crying Leaf to aid in dealing with the drow problem in the nearby Mierani Forest, she was able to help kill the same green dragon responsible for her motherâ€™s death.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Shalelu is now in one of the happiest times of her life, and has been seized with a restless wanderlust. In recent years, Shalelu has built a strong friendship with Ameiko Kaijitsu as well, and sees her as a younger sister. Shalelu knows that Ameiko is haunted by tragedies, and in some ways sees a reflection of her own sad history in Ameiko. Shalelu hopes to find some way soon of helping her friend overcome her melancholiaâ€”perhaps a nice long trip will fit the bill.</p>
